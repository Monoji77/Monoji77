- :shamrock: Currently grinding out python's sklearn and tableau visualisations

I am a year 3 data science and analytics undergraduate. My school's curriculum has enforced the learning of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra during the first 2 years of my academic journey. What I have theoretical knowledge in, I lack in the coding experience. I am going to attempt churning out quality projects showcasing the data science concepts taught in my machine learning projects. I am also looking for a data science-related internship to gain full stack industrial experience. Enjoy looking at my attempts at various datasets.
